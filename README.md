# Forecasting-Wine-Sales

As an analyst at ABC Estate Wines, we have access to historical data on the sales of various types of wines
throughout the 20th century. These datasets, though originating from the same company, reflect sales figures
for different wine varieties. Our goal is to explore this data to identify trends, patterns, and factors that have
influenced wine sales over the century. By applying data analytics and forecasting techniques, we aim to
extract actionable insights that will guide strategic decision-making and help optimize sales strategies for the
future.
